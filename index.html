    <div class="short-biography">
        <p>
            Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, 
            chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's 
            proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the 
            Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise 
            that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.
            Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military 
            engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the 
            Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven
            notes, simply called "Notes".
            Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of 
            computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many
            consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm 
            designed to be carried out by a machine.

                <p>
                    Augusta Ada Byron was born in December 1815 in London. 
                    Her parents were Anne Isabella Byron and George Gordon 
                    Byron but best known as Lord Byron. Anne Isabella 
                    (called Annabella) was a good mathematician and was already 
                    gifted as a child. Her parents hired a retired professor from
                    Cambridge University and she received an education in classical 
                    literature, philosophy, science and mathematics. At the time of 
                    Ada's birth, Lord Byron was one of England's most famous poets and a 
                    supporter of romanticism. He was a notorious womanizer, constantly in 
                    debt and had a reputation as "mad, bad and dangerous to know".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The marriage between Annabella and Byron may seem strange as they 
                    were very different but they were married at the beginning of 1815.
                     The marriage did not last long but a month after Ada's birth they 
                     separated and Byron fled to France and would never see his daughter again.

                <p>
                    Worried that Ada would get some of her father's more rebellious traits or 
                    interest in poetry, Ada was given a strict upbringing similar to her mother's
                     in i.a. mathematics and logic. In an extract from her governess's diary we can 
                     read the following about her schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the age of 13, she had, among other things, William Frend as a teacher (who
                    had been her mother's private tutor) and through him she got to know Mary 
                    Somerville who was a mathematician and popular writer. Through Mary, Ada got 
                    an entrance into London's scientific and literary society and in 1833 she met
                    Charles Babbage. In 1835 she married William King, a slightly older gentleman 
                    who shared and encouraged Ada's interest in mathematics. In 1838 King became 
                    "Earl of Lovelace" and Ada then became "Countess of Lovelace" and then Ada
                    Lovelace. They moved a little outside London and had three children. In a 
                    letter to Mary Somerville we can read the following about Ada's dedication
                    to mathematics.

                <p>
                    Charles Babbage began work on his "The Analytical Engine" in the mid 1830s 
                    and he and Ada Lovelace became good friends and she served as a sounding 
                    board and was fascinated by this machine and its possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1840, Babbage was invited to Turin to give a lecture attended by Luigi 
                    Menabrea, a young Italian engineer. He then wrote the first text on 
                    "The Analytical Engine". In 1844, Ada was asked to translate this text into 
                    English, where she also expanded a lot, e.g. with the appendix known as "Note
                     G" containing instructions for how a program in "The Analytical Engine" would 
                     work. It is "Note G" that is usually called the first computer program and Ada 
                     therefore the first programmer.

                        a talent for numbers and language.

                         was 17 when she meant Charles Babbage.
